// Package ocsp is the OCSP revocation-checking engine for upstream TLS
// certificates: a TTL'd verdict cache plus the responder query pipeline
// behind a tls.Config VerifyPeerCertificate callback. Extracted from package
// main per ADR-0002; the transport wiring (ConfigureTLSConfigOCSP /
// ConfigureTransportOCSP, under the P5.3 upstream-transport ownership
// contract) and the globalOCSP singleton stay in main (ocsp.go shim).
//
// When enabled, the proxy verifies that upstream server certificates have not
// been revoked by checking OCSP stapled responses and, as a fallback, querying
// OCSP responders listed in the certificate's AIA extension.
//
// # CHAOS-65 — the input to this engine is chosen by the party being checked
//
// Everything this package acts on comes out of the PEER's certificate: the
// responder URLs (`leaf.OCSPServer`), how many of them there are, and — because
// the peer names the responder — the bytes that come back. Four rules follow,
// and none of them may be relaxed:
//
//  1. A response is a verdict only when it is BOUND to the certificate under
//     test (ParseResponseForCert, never ParseResponse) and FRESH. Without the
//     binding, a genuine CA-signed "good" about any other certificate of the
//     same issuer answers for this one; without the freshness check, a "good"
//     captured before revocation replays forever, since the request carries no
//     nonce and OCSP rides plaintext HTTP.
//  2. A verdict must be AFFIRMATIVE — Good or Revoked. "Unknown" means the
//     issuer does not recognise the certificate, which is the answer a
//     mis-issued or forged certificate draws; it is not a pass. (Same rule as
//     CHAOS-53 for the scan sidecar.)
//  3. The responder URL is an SSRF sink. Scheme allow-list + ssrf.PrivateHost
//     before the request, an SSRF-controlled dialer under it, and redirects
//     refused outright — a guard on the first URL alone is bypassed by a 302.
//  4. The work is BOUNDED as an envelope, not per step: at most maxResponders
//     entries, all of them inside one queryBudget, single-flighted per
//     certificate. This runs on the request goroutine inside a TLS handshake.

// certificate is not an option — pinned by
