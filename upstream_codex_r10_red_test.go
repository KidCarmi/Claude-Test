// PR-C19 RED matrix — the tenth Codex round on the Batch 2 PR head
// (923406db), written against that tree BEFORE any correction.
//
//   R10-A  stripUpstreamCredentialsFromSettings decoded ONE JSON value and
//          never looked at the bytes after it, so a settings body whose
//          leading object is credential-free followed by a second value
//          (or trailing garbage) carrying a plaintext legacy upstream URL
//          was returned UNCHANGED and packed verbatim while the manifest
//          asserted credentialsOmitted: true. A body with anything but
//          whitespace after the settings object must fail the backup
//          CLOSED; trailing whitespace stays accepted.
//   R10-B  normalizeHost decided "IPv6" by net.ParseIP(host).To4() == nil,
//          so an IPv4-MAPPED IPv6 spelling (`::ffff:192.0.2.1`, To4()
//          non-nil) was left unbracketed: Authority() produced a URL
//          url.Parse refuses and the pool rebuild silently omitted the
//          persisted entry; the bracketed spelling was refused by the same
//          To4 test. IPv6 URL syntax (a colon) decides, To4() never does,
//          and exactly one bracket pair is preserved.
