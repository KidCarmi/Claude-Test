//   R15-A  (P2) After stripping at least one v2 credential the sanitizer
//          re-serialized the WHOLE settings document and refused it if the
//          bytes `"ciphertext"`, `"keyId"` or `"authorityHash"` appeared
//          ANYWHERE — so a legitimate operator-controlled map key unrelated
//          to upstream settings (an OTLP header named `KeyId` under
//          `otlp_headers`, an unrelated section carrying `ciphertext`)
//          combined with a real v2 credential refused the backup even
//          though the credential itself had been removed. Removal must be
//          verified within the v2 credential structures, never by
//          forbidding those names throughout the sanitized settings.
