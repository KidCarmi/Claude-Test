# Changelog

All notable changes to Culvert are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the API contract
version is `info.version` in `api/openapi/openapi.yaml` and follows
`docs/api/API-VERSIONING-POLICY.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Scan-service credential exposure on the viewer-role read surfaces
  (`GET /api/security-scan/svc`, `GET /api/security-scan/status`). The
  userinfo redaction added for those surfaces returned unparseable input
  verbatim, so a `-scan-svc-url` password containing a bare `%`, a control
  character or a space — all of which make `url.Parse` fail while remaining
  perfectly legal in a password — was echoed in cleartext to any viewer.
  The same input also produced a `*url.Error{Op:"parse"}` carrying the raw
  URL, which both surfaces spliced into their JSON. Redaction is now
  fail-closed (`internal/redaction.URLUserinfo`, lexical fallback), probe
  failures render a bounded reason class only
  (`internal/secscan.ProbeFailureReason`), and the two startup log lines
  that wrote the configured URL verbatim are redacted.
- MCP live side-effect boundary: `AdmitSideEffect` switched on the
  admission denial class with no `default`, so a class added later would
  fall through onto the admit path and authorize an irreversible upstream
  tool call. Every class defined today was handled, so the hole was latent;
  the boundary now denies what it cannot classify.
- `google.golang.org/grpc` bumped `v1.83.1` → `v1.83.2` (CVE-2026-84445,
  HIGH: gRPC-Go xDS servers, denial of service via crash). Module graph
  only; no code change.

### Added

- New React/TypeScript admin frontend, Batch 2 (`CULVERT_EXPERIMENTAL_UI`,
  `/app/`): Policies (Access Rules, Authentication Rules, Policy Tester,
  Header Rewrite, Policy Learning), Objects (URL Categories, Category Groups,
  Decryption Profiles, File Profiles), Security (Content Security,
  Decryption, CDR Integration) and Network (PAC, Upstream Proxies), with the
  backend trust and concurrency corrections recorded in
  `docs/design/FRONTEND-MIGRATION-PLAN.md` §FE-5.
- Admin UI listener health surfaces (CHAOS-57), all on the **proxy** port so
  they survive the fault they describe: `admin_ui` on `GET /health`, a
  report-only `admin_ui` row on `GET /ready`, the `admin_ui_listener`
  operator-contract row on `GET /api/diagnostics`, the
  `culvert_admin_ui_{up,unavailable,listen_failures_total,binds_total,listen_backoff_seconds}`
  series, and the `admin_ui_unavailable` alert. The readiness row never gates
  the default verdict — a node whose admin UI is down is still proxying.
- `CULVERT_DATA_DIR` — startup-scoped override of the persisted-state root
  (default `/data`, unchanged when unset). Every persisted-state path —
  including the config-version store, registry settings, the CDR
  enrollment certs root and runtime marker, and the alert retry queue —
  follows the override.
- Admin API operations (contract 2.0.0): `GET /api/rewrite/state`,
  `GET /api/fileblock/profiles/state`, `GET /api/urlcat/state`,
  `GET /api/pac/profiles/{name}/lifecycle`, the Upstream v2 entry endpoints
  (`/api/upstream/entries`, `/api/upstream/entries/{id}`,
  `/api/upstream/entries/{id}/credential`) and the CDR enrollment recovery
  endpoints (`/api/cdr/instances/enroll/recover`,
  `/api/cdr/instances/enroll/receipts`).

### Changed — API contract 1.2.0 → 2.0.0 (BREAKING)

The admin API contract takes a MAJOR bump. Every change below is the
documented behaviour of the appliance after the Batch 2 backend corrections;
consumers of the affected operations must migrate.

- **Structured refusals replace `text/plain` error bodies** on the policy,
  authentication-policy and upstream mutation operations (400) and on the
  PAC lifecycle operation (409): a refusal is now `application/json`
  `{error, code, current}` (the `RefusalBody`/`UpstreamRefusal` schemas).
  Consumers that parsed the plain-text body must read `code` instead.
- **Delete operations answer 204 No Content instead of 200**:
  `DELETE /api/authpolicy`, `DELETE /api/pac/pools/{name}`,
  `DELETE /api/pac/posture/exceptions/{name}`,
  `DELETE /api/pac/profiles/{name}`.
- **Revision fencing is required on PAC deletes**: `?etag=` on
  `DELETE /api/pac/pools/{name}`, `?revision=` on
  `DELETE /api/pac/posture/exceptions/{name}` and
  `DELETE /api/pac/profiles/{name}` (428 when absent, 409 `stale` when
  behind, 404 `vanished` when gone).
- **Identity parameters became required**: `?name=` on
  `DELETE /api/cdr/policies`, `?pattern=` on `DELETE /api/content-scan` and
  `DELETE /api/dpi`, `?id=` on `DELETE /api/security-scan/yara/rules`
  (the former `name` selector was removed).
- **Request bodies tightened**: `enabled` is required on
  `PUT /api/cdr/config`; the body is required on
  `POST /api/cdr/instances/revoke`; `proxies[].url` is required on
  `POST /api/upstream` (the credential-free v1 adapter); the decryption
  profile security fields are closed enumerations on
  `POST`/`PUT /api/decryption-profiles` (`permissive` is no longer
  accepted); `?dryRun=` on `POST /api/config/import` is the enumeration
  `1`.
- The credential-free `POST /api/upstream` adapter and
  `DELETE /api/upstream/entries/{id}` refuse while an entry holds credential
  material OR carries the `requiresReplacement` marker (409
  `credentialed_entries_present` / `credential_present`).

Migration: read `code` from JSON refusal bodies; treat 204 as success on the
listed deletes; echo the current `etag`/`revision` on PAC deletes; send the
now-required identity parameters and body fields; use the per-entry Upstream
endpoints for credentialed parents.

### Performance

- The top-hosts counter's tracked-host path is lock-free. `topHosts.Record`
  runs on every allowed request and took a process-wide `RWMutex` read lock
  to read a map that in steady state never changes; `RLock`/`RUnlock` are two
  atomic read-modify-writes on one shared word, so this was a throughput
  ceiling rather than a constant cost — on a 4-core box it measured 35.8 /
  92.6 / 96.8 ns/op at 1 / 2 / 4 cores, i.e. four cores delivered 0.37x the
  throughput of one. Backed by a `sync.Map` it measures 42.0 / 26.1 / 16.1
  ns/op — 6.0x at four cores and a curve that improves with core count. The
  distinct-host cap, the decay pass and `Top` are unchanged and still
  serialised. No API, metric, or dashboard change.

### Fixed

- An admin UI listener failure no longer terminates the proxy data plane
  (CHAOS-57). `startUI`'s listen goroutine called `logFatalf`, so an occupied
  admin port or an unreadable `-tls-cert`/`-tls-key` pair exited the whole
  process — under `restart: unless-stopped`, an unattended crash loop with no
  proxy, no admin UI and no health endpoint. The listener now rebinds with a
  jittered, interruptible backoff for as long as the process lives, re-reading
  the certificate on every attempt so a rotation self-heals with no restart,
  while the proxy keeps enforcing policy throughout. `runProxyUntilShutdown`'s
  fatal proxy-listener branch is deliberately unchanged. See
  `docs/operator/admin-ui-listener-recovery.md`.
- `culvert --prepare-downgrade` now writes its counts-only audit record to
  the durable audit log named by `-audit-log` before exiting.
- The real-binary browser smoke and the upstream test suites are hermetic
  under any user and any shuffle order (per-instance data roots; the
  rejected-document latch is reset per test environment).
